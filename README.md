Artificial Intelligence has a significant impact on all aspects of Fashion,from designing to production and consumption. Fashion has always been a forward-looking phenomenon, willing to adopt new technologies as they emerge. Artificial Intelligence is no exception as it moves as fast as Fashion.It has been used in analyzing fashion trends and consumer needs for over a decade. Its impact on style and the enhancement of phenomena as Fast Fashion, is indisputable. The clothing industry 4.0 digitalization is increasingly relying on the use of advanced technology, moving towards its 5.0 version, the use of Artificial Intelligence in the broader scope of activities.Ranging from Recommendation Systems, Anamoly Detection in Textiles, Smart textiles, Ai based Designing, Trend prediction etc to name a few. This repo is a collection of all of my attempts during my undergrad thesis to apply AI to the Fashion Industry.
## List of Projects

- Using Generative Adversarial Networks , GuccioAI able to generate clothing images and mix these images. While mixing, you can control which structure or style that you want the clothing to copy. Additionally, you can edit the generated clothing with several given attributes such as dark color, jacket, dress, or coat.

2. ### [iDresser : An AI Based Fashion Recommendation Assistant](https://github.com/AdiNarendra98/AI-for-Fashion/tree/main/iDresser-An%20AI%20Based%20Fashion%20Assistant)

- Using Neural Nets, iDresser unlike the conventional systems that rely on the user's previous purchases and history, this project aims at using an image of a product given as input by the user to generate recommendations since many-a-time people see something that they are interested in and tend to look for products that are similar to that.

3. ### [What's this Called(Fashion Clothing Segementation)](https://github.com/AdiNarendra98/AI-for-Fashion/tree/main/What's%20this%20Called(Fashion%20Clothing%20Segementation))
![WtCiF](https://github.com/AdiNarendra98/AI-for-Fashion/blob/main/ss/What's%20this%20Called.png)
- The system uses pixel-wise detection algorthims to detect various product categories in the user input image and then segments it to particular types of clothing like Tshirts, Pants, Jackets etc and further can be used to find similar products based on a certain kind of segementation.


4. ### [Rent the Fashion : A Rental Clothing Recommender System](https://github.com/AdiNarendra98/AI-for-Fashion/tree/main/Rent%20the%20Fashion(Rental%20Clothing%20Recommender))
![Rentit](https://github.com/AdiNarendra98/AI-for-Fashion/blob/main/ss/Rent%20the%20Fashion.png)
- A recommender system that recommends the clothes to the female customers for their rental purpose. The rental purposes depend on the activities a user wants to carry out, such as: vacation, meetings, weddings, dates, etc. The recommendation is based on the features like customersâ€™ height, weight, bust size, body type, age, and reason to rent.This improves costumer's experience and preserves trend in fashion.
