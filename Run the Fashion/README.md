# Clothing-Recommender-System

Project   : Large Scale Analytics

University: San Jose State 

Semester  : Second (Fall-2019)


We built a recommender system that recommends the clothes to the female customers for their rental purpose. The rental purposes depend on the activities a user wants to carry out, such as: vacation, meetings, weddings, dates, etc. The recommendation is based on the features like customers’ height, weight, bust size, body type, age, and reason to rent. 

The objective of this project is to group the users by their predicted body type and renting purpose, and apply collaborative filtering on them to recommend the clothes to our customer, based on the ratings of the most similar user. The goal of recommending the clothes is to improve the customers’ shopping experience and preserve the ongoing trend in fashion world.
