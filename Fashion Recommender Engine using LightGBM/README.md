# Fashion Recommender Engine using LightGBM

We develop a personalized fashion recommender system by integrating collaborative filtering and gradient boosting techniques. Our models are trained using the H&M Fashion Dataset and Kaggleâ€™s Fashion Product datasets. To extract meaningful insights from product metadata and customer transactions, we employ text processing (TF-IDF), truncated SVD for dimensionality reduction, cosine similarity, and collaborative filtering. The performance of LightGBM and User-User Collaborative Filtering (UUCF) is evaluated using the Mean Average Precision @ 12 (MAP@12) metric. Our findings demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms filtering-based approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in improving recommendation accuracy.
