## üöÄIntroduction

### üéâGeneral info 

- Unlike the conventional systems that rely on the user's previous purchases and history, this project aims at using an image of a product given as input by the user to generate recommendations since many-a-time people see something that they are interested in and tend to look for products that are similar to that.

-  **We use neural networks to process the images from Fashion Product Images Dataset and the Nearest neighbour backed recommender to generate the final recommendations.**


### ‚úçPurpose

- Humans are inevitably drawn towards something that is visually more attractive. This tendency of humans has led to development of fashion industry over the course of time. With introduction of recommender systems in multiple domains, retail industries are coming forward with investments in latest technology to improve their business. Fashion has been in existence since centuries and will be prevalent in the coming days as well. Women are more correlated with fashion and style, and they have a larger product base to deal with making it difficult to take decisions. It has become an important aspect of life for modern families since a person is more often than not judged based on his attire. Moreover, apparel providers need their customers to explore their entire product line so they can choose what they like the most which is not possible by simply going into a cloth store.




##   üíªRecommendation Engine:Proposed Methodology 

In this project, we propose a model that uses Convolutional Neural Network and the Nearest 
neighbour backed recommender. As shown in the figure Initially, the neural networks are trained and then 
an inventory is selected for generating recommendations and a database is created for the items in 
inventory. The nearest neighbour‚Äôs algorithm is used to find the most relevant products based on the 
input image and recommendations are generated.

## üìäApplication Flow-Chart


To generate recommendations, our proposed approach uses Sklearn Nearest neighbours . This allows us to find the nearest neighbours for the 
given input image. The similarity measure used in this Project is the Cosine Similarity measure. The top 5 
recommendations are extracted from the database and their images are displayed.

## Convolutional Neural Networks

- Convolutional Neural Network is a specialized neural network designed for visual data, such as images & videos. But CNNs also work well for non-image data (especially in NLP & text classification).
- Its concept is similar to that of a vanilla neural network (multilayer perceptron) ‚Äì It follows the same general principle of forwarding & backward propagation.
  
- Once the data is pre-processed, the neural networks are trained, utilizing transfer learning 
  from ResNet50. More additional layers are added in the last layers that replace the architecture and 
  weights from ResNet50 in order to fine-tune the network model to serve the current issue. The figure
  shows the ResNet50 architecture.

## Getting the inventory

The images from Kaggle Fashion Product Images Dataset. The 
inventory is then run through the neural networks to classify and generate embeddings and the output 
is then used to generate recommendations. 

### The Figure shows a sample set of inventory data

## Experiment and results

The concept of Transfer learning is used to overcome the issues of the small size Fashion dataset. 
Therefore we pre-train the classification models on the DeepFashion dataset that consists of 44,441
garment images. The networks are trained and validated on the dataset taken. The training results 
show a great accuracy of the model with low error, loss and good f-score.

## üí°Challenges Faced and Learnings

- Had very basic knowledge of Deep Learning before the Microsoft Engage Program's qualification announcement. Spentquality time on learning the new concepts attached to Deep Learning and then began the design-build process of this project.

- Had to learn streamlit for creating graphical UI.

- Setting the dependencies with proper version is the most critical.

## ‚ú®Conclusion

In this project, we have presented a novel framework for fashion recommendation that is driven by data, 
visually related and simple effective recommendation systems for generating fashion product images. 
The proposed approach uses a two-stage phase. Initially, our proposed approach extracts the features 
of the image using CNN classifier ie., for instance allowing the customers to upload any random 
fashion image from any E-commerce website and later generating similar images to the uploaded image 
based on the features and texture of the input image. It is imperative that such research goes forward 
to facilitate greater recommendation accuracy and improve the overall experience of fashion 
exploration for direct and indirect consumers alike.
